Either way, I <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">😣dislike</span> the feeling of accidentally introducing <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">🐛bugs</span> with my code. I've done it before, and I am the type of person to wake up in a 🧊cold sweat in the middle of the <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">🌔night</span> wondering why that page just doesn't quite scroll to the top in the right way.</p>\n    <p class=\"text-lg pb-4\">It is even more <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">👻soul</span> crushing when that issue doesn't even happen until the code has gone through a <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">🔁continuous</span> integration workflow and ended up in some data center somewhere; oh, and also, all of the source maps are gone. This isn't even considering that you might be working on something highly <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">👁visible</span> that you wouldn't really want to be working on in production while there are people actively interacting with it.</p>\n    <h4 class=\"text-xl pb-4\"><em>Why doesn't it work?</em></h4>\n    <p class=\"text-lg pb-4\">Maybe, it is a bad <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">⚙config</span>, or <em>maybe</em>, the thing you designed is fundamentally incompatible with the thing you are hosting it on, or <em>maybe</em>, it is just a bad <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">⚙config</span>. It is really hard to tell🤔. Is it even <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">🚀deploying?</span> Hold on, let me read the logs.</p>\n    <h4 class=\"text-xl pb-4\"><em>Oh, I think I fixed it!</em></h4>\n    <p class=\"text-lg pb-4\">Oh, wait, no. It was just cached from before it broke.</p>\n    <h4 class=\"text-lg pb-4\"><em>Is this just a part of being human?</em></h4>\n    <p class=\"text-lg pb-4\">Am I doomed to fail? Is acceptance of my humanity the only thing that will relieve me from my <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">😣suffering?</span> I don't know. I <em>can't</em> say for sure, but I do know that, as a <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">👩human</span>, I am bound to make <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">❌mistakes</span>. I am getting better at not ruminating on the past, but my progress isn't a straight <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">📈line</span>. Growth is all about making mistakes. You can't learn how to do something unless you try. You can't know if something works in production unless you put it in production.</p>\n    <h4 class=\"text-xl\">So, go ahead! Press that 🚀deploy button!</h4>\n    <p class=\"text-lg pb-4\"><em>Unless, that is a bad idea for you; idk your life🤷‍♀️</em></p>\n  </div>\n</root>","title":"It works in dev.
